McCulloch and the logician Walter Pitts. The MCP model abstracts the biological notion of a neuron as a mathematical model containing:\n",

    "* $m$ binary input signals, $\\ x_1, x_2, ..., x_m \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\n",

    "* An _activation function_, $\\ f:\\{0,1\\}^{m} \\to \\{0,1\\}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "The logic is as follows:\n",

    "### The MCP Neuron in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've covered the basic math for the MCP Neuron, we can get to the fun part: implementing it in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Each logic gate is completely determined by its weights and its threshold value_. So the idea is to define a class which takes in the weight and threshold value as inputs, from which we can define each type of gate. We can then define a simple process which takes in input signals, applies an activation function (using the input weights) and then uses the threshold value to _decide_ if the output of that signal is a $1$ or a $0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make the exercise more lively, we can use the Python script to generate truth tables (see the logic gate reference above) for each logic gate. Truth tables are also a niceway of quickly analysing how different weights and thresholds change the behaviour of each logic gate. \n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things simple, the `decide` function below, which decides if a set of inputs returns a $1$ or a $0$, operates only on 1-D arrays (list) of signals; as opposed to a truth table which is a 2-D matrix. Thus we can define the concept of a _message_:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a _message_ is an $m$-dimensional vector of binary input signals, $(x_1, x_2, ..., x_m) \\in \\{0,1\\}^{m}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, ignoring the last column of the truth table (which is the output signal), each row of the truth table is a message. Finally we can abstract the truth table (ignoring the last column) as a set of $n$ messages, where $n$ is the number of rows of the truth table. \n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure for generating truth tables is then to make a decision on each row and append the output signals to the table (which is a 2-D array).\n",
